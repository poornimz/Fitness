The Exercise Tracker and Integrated Curl Counter is a sophisticated system that uses advanced deep learning techniques to accurately track and count exercise repetitions, specifically focusing on bicep curls.

Steps to follow for HUMAN ACTION RECOGNITION FILE:

Step 1: Visualize the Data with its Labels

Step 2: Preprocess the Dataset

Step 3: Split the Data into Train and Test Set

Step 4: Implement the ConvLSTM Approach

Step 4.1: Construct the Model

Step 4.2: Compile & Train the Model

Step 4.3: Plot Model’s Loss & Accuracy Curves

Step 5: implement the LRCN Approach

Step 5.1: Construct the Model

Step 5.2: Compile & Train the Model

Step 5.3: Plot Model’s Loss & Accuracy Curves

Step 6: Test the Best Performing Model on YouTube videos
Here, instead of step 6 we developed another one real-time activity tracker(exercise decoder file ) which will count respective exercise and the we downloaded the video from there and fed it to input here(for simply testing it with realtime ,unseen data), Finally our model Recognised the correct activity and its working well with good accuracy score.
